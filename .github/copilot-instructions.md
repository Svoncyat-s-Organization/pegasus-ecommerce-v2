# 🦄 Project Context: Pegasus E-commerce (MVP)

**Description:**
Pegasus is a monolithic e-commerce backend (Spring Boot) and SPA frontend (React) built for an academic MVP.
**Architecture:** Package-by-Feature (Strict). Do not organize by layers. The system serves two distinct user types: **Backoffice Staff** (Admins/Workers) and **Storefront Customers**.

## 1. Quality Assurance
* **STRICT RULE:** The code provided must be executable and error-free.
* **Executable Code:** All code provided must be compile-ready.
* **Backend (Java):**
    * Ensure all code provided compiles correctly.
    * If acting as an Agent/CLI: Run `./mvnw clean compile` to verify before submitting changes.
    * Do not leave unused imports or broken references.
* **Frontend (React/Vite):**
    * Ensure code passes linting rules.
    * If acting as an Agent/CLI: Run `npm run lint` or `npm run build` to verify logic.
* **Self-Correction:** If a generated solution is complex, review it against the project's compilation capability before outputting.

## 2. Tone & Output Format
* **Professional & Technical:** Maintain a strict, technical tone.
* **NO Emojis:** Do NOT use emojis in responses, comments, or commit messages. Output must be clean text and code only. In code, only icons are allowed.
* **English:** All code, variables, and comments must be in English.
* **Concise:** Go straight to the solution.
